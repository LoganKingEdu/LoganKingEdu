Hi there! I'm Logan. I'm a sophomore pursuing a B.A. in computer science and a minor in digital media studies at the University of Minnesota. 
I’m interested in the new world of gamification, applying game fundamentals such as achievements and sources of engagement to other aspects of life to make things more enjoyable.
I plan to utilize my degree to create software to better people, and make some of the less enjoyable things in life more enjoyable. That and also make some pretty cool games.
I have about a semester of experience in Java, Python, C, and OCaml, and have done some extra work with Java and javascript in my free time. 
I started my personal project developments with a personal design of chess in Java, as you can see on my profile.
